	SUPPORT:
	
	This code is provided "as is", and I cannot provide free support.
	Prior versions of tinyBIOS have been used by many customers, with
	minimal support required. Contact me for a quote on customer
	specific support, adaptations etc.

	INSTALLATION:
	
	To assemble tinyBIOS, you need to buy the A386 assembler (www.eji.com).
	A linker is not required.
	
	The source code was written using tab stops in columns 11, 19, 41.
	The editor built into AS.COM will handle this correctly. See
	TOOL\ED.DOC for details on how to use this editor.
	
	To assemble the WRAP BIOS, go to the WRAP directory and see the
	batch files there.
